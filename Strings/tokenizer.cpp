//A tokenizer which will split the string at each delimeter.
//For example, assume this string:
//         You're tearing me apart Lisa!
//Let's tokenize the string by splitting at each space character:
//         You're, tearing, me, apart, Lisa!
//If we tokenized the string at each apostrophe, we'd end up with this list:
//         You're, tearing me apart Lisa!
